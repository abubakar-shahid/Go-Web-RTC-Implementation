now i want to make a go client and a node signaling server to communicate with this js client through web rtc. the js client will initiate the request and send its sdps to the go client for connection. after establishing the connection through signaling server, the js client will be sending the recorded video to the go client through data channel using the peer to peer connection established. once the video is sent, the go client will download the video automatically as soon as it receives the video.
